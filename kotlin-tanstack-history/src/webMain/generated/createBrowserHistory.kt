package tanstack.history

/**
 * Creates a history object that can be used to interact with the browser's
 * navigation. This is a lightweight API wrapping the browser's native methods.
 * It is designed to work with TanStack Router, but could be used as a standalone API as well.
 * IMPORTANT: This API implements history throttling via a microtask to prevent
 * excessive calls to the history API. In some browsers, calling history.pushState or
 * history.replaceState in quick succession can cause the browser to ignore subsequent
 * calls. This API smooths out those differences and ensures that your application
 * state will *eventually* match the browser state. In most cases, this is not a problem,
 * but if you need to ensure that the browser state is up to date, you can use the
 * `history.flush` method to immediately flush all pending state changes to the browser URL.
 * @param opts
 * @param opts.getHref A function that returns the current href (path + search + hash)
 * @param opts.createHref A function that takes a path and returns a href (path + search + hash)
 * @returns A history instance
