external class HeightmapTerrainData(options: ConstructorOptions) : TerrainData {
    /**
     * @property [buffer] The buffer containing height data.
     * @property [width] The width (longitude direction) of the heightmap, in samples.
     * @property [height] The height (latitude direction) of the heightmap, in samples.
     * @property [childTileMask] A bit mask indicating which of this tile's four children exist.
     *   If a child's bit is set, geometry will be requested for that tile as well when it
     *   is needed.  If the bit is cleared, the child tile is not requested and geometry is
     *   instead upsampled from the parent.
     *   Default value - `15`
     * @property [waterMask] The water mask included in this terrain data, if any.  A water mask is a square
     *   Uint8Array or image where a value of 255 indicates water and a value of 0 indicates land.
     *   Values in between 0 and 255 are allowed as well to smoothly blend between land and water.
     * @property [structure] An object describing the structure of the height data.
     * @property [structure.heightScale] The factor by which to multiply height samples in order to obtain
     *   the height above the heightOffset, in meters.  The heightOffset is added to the resulting
     *   height after multiplying by the scale.
     *   Default value - `1.0`
     * @property [structure.heightOffset] The offset to add to the scaled height to obtain the final
     *   height in meters.  The offset is added after the height sample is multiplied by the
     *   heightScale.
     *   Default value - `0.0`
     * @property [structure.elementsPerHeight] The number of elements in the buffer that make up a single height
     *   sample.  This is usually 1, indicating that each element is a separate height sample.  If
     *   it is greater than 1, that number of elements together form the height sample, which is
     *   computed according to the structure.elementMultiplier and structure.isBigEndian properties.
     *   Default value - `1`
     * @property [structure.stride] The number of elements to skip to get from the first element of
     *   one height to the first element of the next height.
     *   Default value - `1`
     * @property [structure.elementMultiplier] The multiplier used to compute the height value when the
     *   stride property is greater than 1.  For example, if the stride is 4 and the strideMultiplier
     *   is 256, the height is computed as follows:
     *   `height = buffer[index] + buffer[index + 1] * 256 + buffer[index + 2] * 256 * 256 + buffer[index + 3] * 256 * 256 * 256`
     *   This is assuming that the isBigEndian property is false.  If it is true, the order of the
     *   elements is reversed.
     *   Default value - `256.0`
     * @property [structure.isBigEndian] Indicates endianness of the elements in the buffer when the
     *   stride property is greater than 1.  If this property is false, the first element is the
     *   low-order element.  If it is true, the first element is the high-order element.
     *   Default value - `false`
     * @property [structure.lowestEncodedHeight] The lowest value that can be stored in the height buffer.  Any heights that are lower
     *   than this value after encoding with the `heightScale` and `heightOffset` are clamped to this value.  For example, if the height
     *   buffer is a `Uint16Array`, this value should be 0 because a `Uint16Array` cannot store negative numbers.  If this parameter is
     *   not specified, no minimum value is enforced.
     * @property [structure.highestEncodedHeight] The highest value that can be stored in the height buffer.  Any heights that are higher
     *   than this value after encoding with the `heightScale` and `heightOffset` are clamped to this value.  For example, if the height
     *   buffer is a `Uint16Array`, this value should be `256 * 256 - 1` or 65535 because a `Uint16Array` cannot store numbers larger
     *   than 65535.  If this parameter is not specified, no maximum value is enforced.
     * @property [encoding] The encoding that is used on the buffer.
     *   Default value - [HeightmapEncoding.NONE]
     * @property [createdByUpsampling] True if this instance was created by upsampling another instance;
     *   otherwise, false.
     *   Default value - `false`
