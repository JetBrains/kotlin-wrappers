 * A mixin which adds the [PerformanceWatchdog] widget to the [Viewer] widget.
 * Rather than being called directly, this function is normally passed as
 * a parameter to [Viewer.extend], as shown in the example below.
 * ```
 * const viewer = new Viewer('cesiumContainer');
 * viewer.extend(viewerPerformanceWatchdogMixin, {
 *     lowFrameRateMessage : 'Why is this going so <em>slowly</em>?'
 * });
 * ```
 * @param [viewer] The viewer instance.
 * @param [options] An object with properties.
 * @see <a href="https://cesium.com/docs/cesiumjs-ref-doc/viewerPerformanceWatchdogMixin.html">Online Documentation</a>
