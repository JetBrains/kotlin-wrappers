     * Controls handling of invalid or ambiguous times caused by time zone
     * offset changes like Daylight Saving time (DST) transitions.
     *
     * This option is only relevant if a `DateTime` value does not exist in the
     * destination time zone (e.g. near "Spring Forward" DST transitions), or
     * exists more than once (e.g. near "Fall Back" DST transitions).
     *
     * In case of ambiguous or nonexistent times, this option controls what
     * exact time to return:
     * - `'compatible'`: Equivalent to `'earlier'` for backward transitions like
     *   the start of DST in the Spring, and `'later'` for forward transitions
     *   like the end of DST in the Fall. This matches the behavior of legacy
     *   `Date`, of libraries like moment.js, Luxon, or date-fns, and of
     *   cross-platform standards like [RFC 5545
     *   (iCalendar)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545).
     * - `'earlier'`: The earlier time of two possible times
     * - `'later'`: The later of two possible times
     * - `'reject'`: Throw a RangeError instead
     *
     * The default is `'compatible'`.
