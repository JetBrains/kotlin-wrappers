     * Time zone definitions can change. If an application stores data about
     * events in the future, then stored data about future events may become
     * ambiguous, for example if a country permanently abolishes DST. The
     * `offset` option controls this unusual case.
     *
     * - `'use'` always uses the offset (if it's provided) to calculate the
     *   instant. This ensures that the result will match the instant that was
     *   originally stored, even if local clock time is different.
     * - `'prefer'` uses the offset if it's valid for the date/time in this time
     *   zone, but if it's not valid then the time zone will be used as a
     *   fallback to calculate the instant.
     * - `'ignore'` will disregard any provided offset. Instead, the time zone
     *    and date/time value are used to calculate the instant. This will keep
     *    local clock time unchanged but may result in a different real-world
     *    instant.
     * - `'reject'` acts like `'prefer'`, except it will throw a RangeError if
     *   the offset is not valid for the given time zone identifier and
     *   date/time value.
     *
     * If the ISO string ends in 'Z' then this option is ignored because there
     * is no possibility of ambiguity.
     *
     * If a time zone offset is not present in the input, then this option is
     * ignored because the time zone will always be used to calculate the
     * offset.
     *
     * If the offset is not used, and if the date/time and time zone don't
     * uniquely identify a single instant, then the `disambiguation` option will
     * be used to choose the correct instant. However, if the offset is used
     * then the `disambiguation` option will be ignored.
