     *   `roundingIncrement` and `smallestUnit`. When there is a tie, round up.
     *   This mode is the default.
     * - `ceil`: Always round up, towards the end of time.
     * - `trunc`: Always round down, towards the beginning of time.
     * - `floor`: Also round down, towards the beginning of time. This mode acts
     *   the same as `trunc`, but it's included for consistency with
     *   `Temporal.Duration.round()` where negative values are allowed and
     *   `trunc` rounds towards zero, unlike `floor` which rounds towards
     *   negative infinity which is usually unexpected. For this reason, `trunc`
     *   is recommended for most use cases.
