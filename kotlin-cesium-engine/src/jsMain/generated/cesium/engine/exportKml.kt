/**
 * Exports an EntityCollection as a KML document. Only Point, Billboard, Model, Path, Polygon, Polyline geometries
 * will be exported. Note that there is not a 1 to 1 mapping of Entity properties to KML Feature properties. For
 * example, entity properties that are time dynamic but cannot be dynamic in KML are exported with their values at
 * options.time or the beginning of the EntityCollection's time interval if not specified. For time-dynamic properties
 * that are supported in KML, we use the samples if it is a [SampledProperty] otherwise we sample the value using
 * the options.sampleDuration. Point, Billboard, Model and Path geometries with time-dynamic positions will be exported
 * as gx:Track Features. Not all Materials are representable in KML, so for more advanced Materials just the primary
 * color is used. Canvas objects are exported as PNG images.
 * ```
 * exportKml({
 *      entities: entityCollection

 *       // externalFiles[file] is a blob with the contents of the file
 *     }
 *   });
 * ```
 * @return A promise that resolved to an object containing the KML string and a dictionary of external file blobs, or a kmz file as a blob if options.kmz is true.
