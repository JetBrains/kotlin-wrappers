     * with crashes that occur in other renderer processes or in the main process.

     * must be no longer than 39 bytes, and values must be no longer than 20320 bytes.

     * longer than the maximum length will be truncated.

     * first call `start` you can call `addExtraParameter`.

     * than the maximum length will be truncated.
