     * Resolves with the response from the main process.

     * Send a message to the main process via `channel` and expect a result
     * asynchronously. Arguments will be serialized with the Structured Clone
     * Algorithm, just like `window.postMessage`, so prototype chains will not be
     * included. Sending Functions, Promises, Symbols, WeakMaps, or WeakSets will throw
     * an exception.
     *
     * The main process should listen for `channel` with `ipcMain.handle()`.
     *
     * For example:
     *
     * If you need to transfer a `MessagePort` to the main process, use
     * `ipcRenderer.postMessage`.
     *
     * If you do not need a response to the message, consider using `ipcRenderer.send`.

     * > **Note** Sending non-standard JavaScript types such as DOM objects or special
     * Electron objects will throw an exception.
     *
     * Since the main process does not have support for DOM objects such as
     * `ImageBitmap`, `File`, `DOMMatrix` and so on, such objects cannot be sent over
     * Electron's IPC to the main process, as the main process would have no way to
     * decode them. Attempting to send such objects over IPC will result in an error.
     *
     * > **Note** If the handler in the main process throws an error, the promise
     * returned by `invoke` will reject. However, the `Error` object in the renderer
     * process will not be the same as the one thrown in the main process.
