     * module gets emitted and can be called only once.
     *
     * Registers the `scheme` as standard, secure, bypasses content security policy for
     * resources, allows registering ServiceWorker, supports fetch API, and streaming
     * video/audio. Specify a privilege with the value of `true` to enable the
     * capability.
     *
     * An example of registering a privileged scheme, that bypasses Content Security
     * Policy:
     *
     * A standard scheme adheres to what RFC 3986 calls generic URI syntax. For example
     * `http` and `https` are standard schemes, while `file` is not.
     *
     * Registering a scheme as standard allows relative and absolute resources to be
     * resolved correctly when served. Otherwise the scheme will behave like the `file`
     * protocol, but without the ability to resolve relative URLs.
     *
     * For example when you load following page with custom protocol without
     * registering it as standard scheme, the image will not be loaded because
     * non-standard schemes can not recognize relative URLs:
     *
     * Registering a scheme as standard will allow access to files through the
     * FileSystem API. Otherwise the renderer will throw a security error for the
     * scheme.
     *
     * By default web storage apis (localStorage, sessionStorage, webSQL, indexedDB,
     * cookies) are disabled for non standard schemes. So in general if you want to
     * register a custom protocol to replace the `http` protocol, you have to register
     * it as a standard scheme.
     *
     * Protocols that use streams (http and stream protocols) should set `stream:
     * true`. The `<video>` and `<audio>` HTML elements expect protocols to buffer
     * their responses by default. The `stream` flag configures those elements to
     * correctly expect streaming responses.
