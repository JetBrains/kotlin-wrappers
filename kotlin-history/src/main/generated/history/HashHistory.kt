/**
 * A hash history stores the current location in the fragment identifier portion
 * of the URL in a web browser environment.
 *
 * This is ideal for apps that do not control the server for some reason
 * (because the fragment identifier is never sent to the server), including some
 * shared hosting environments that do not provide fine-grained controls over
 * which pages are served at which URLs.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/remix-run/history/tree/main/docs/api-reference.md#hashhistory
