 * This gives extensions full control over actions such as edit, save, and backup.
 *
 * You should use this type of custom editor when dealing with binary files or more complex scenarios. For simple
 * text based documents, use {@linkcode CustomTextEditorProvider} instead.

     * the editor as no longer being dirty if the user undoes all edits to the last saved state.

     * `save` or `revert` the file.
     *
     * An editor should only ever fire `CustomDocumentEditEvent` events, or only ever fire `CustomDocumentContentChangeEvent` events.

     * than cancelling it to ensure that the editor has some valid backup.
