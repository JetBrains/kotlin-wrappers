/**
 * Creates and returns a new `DeflateRaw` object.
 *
 * An upgrade of zlib from 1.2.8 to 1.2.11 changed behavior when `windowBits` is set to 8 for raw deflate streams. zlib would automatically set `windowBits` to 9 if was initially set to 8. Newer
 * versions of zlib will throw an exception,
 * so Node.js restored the original behavior of upgrading a value of 8 to 9,
 * since passing `windowBits = 9` to zlib actually results in a compressed stream
 * that effectively uses an 8-bit window only.
 * @since v0.5.8
