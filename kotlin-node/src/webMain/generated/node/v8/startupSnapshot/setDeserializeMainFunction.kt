 * This sets the entry point of the Node.js application when it is deserialized from a snapshot. This can be called only once in the snapshot building script.
 * If called, the deserialized application no longer needs an additional entry point script to start up and will simply invoke the callback along with the deserialized
 * data (if provided), otherwise an entry point script still needs to be provided to the deserialized application.
 * @since v18.6.0, v16.17.0
