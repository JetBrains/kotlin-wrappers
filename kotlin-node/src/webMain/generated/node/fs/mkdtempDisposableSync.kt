/**
 * Returns a disposable object whose `path` property holds the created directory
 * path. When the object is disposed, the directory and its contents will be
 * removed if it still exists. If the directory cannot be deleted, disposal will
 * throw an error. The object has a `remove()` method which will perform the same
 * task.
 *
 * <!-- TODO: link MDN docs for disposables once https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/38027 lands -->
 *
 * For detailed information, see the documentation of `fs.mkdtemp()`.
 *
 * There is no callback-based version of this API because it is designed for use
 * with the `using` syntax.
 *
 * The optional `options` argument can be a string specifying an encoding, or an
 * object with an `encoding` property specifying the character encoding to use.
 * @since v24.4.0
