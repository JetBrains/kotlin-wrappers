 * This function is used to set a custom resolver for the location of the snapshot file used for snapshot testing.
 * By default, the snapshot filename is the same as the entry point filename with `.snapshot` appended.
 * @since v22.3.0
 * @param fn A function used to compute the location of the snapshot file.
 * The function receives the path of the test file as its only argument. If the
 * test is not associated with a file (for example in the REPL), the input is
 * undefined. `fn()` must return a string specifying the location of the snapshot file.
