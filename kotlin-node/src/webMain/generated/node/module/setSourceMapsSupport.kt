/**
 * This function enables or disables the [Source Map v3](https://tc39.es/ecma426/) support for
 * stack traces.
 *
 * It provides same features as launching Node.js process with commandline options
 * `--enable-source-maps`, with additional options to alter the support for files
 * in `node_modules` or generated codes.
 *
 * Only source maps in JavaScript files that are loaded after source maps has been
 * enabled will be parsed and loaded. Preferably, use the commandline options
 * `--enable-source-maps` to avoid losing track of source maps of modules loaded
 * before this API call.
 * @since v22.14.0
