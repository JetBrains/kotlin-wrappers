 * `DatabaseSync` - object will be reflected in the backup right away. However, mutations from other connections will cause
 * the backup process to restart.

 *     console.log('Backup in progress', { totalPages, remainingPages });

 * });
 *
 * console.log('Backup completed', totalPagesTransferred);

 * @param sourceDb The database to backup. The source database must be open.
 * @param path The path where the backup will be created. If the file already exists,
 * the contents will be overwritten.
 * @param options Optional configuration for the backup. The
 * following properties are supported:
 * @returns A promise that resolves when the backup is completed and rejects if an error occurs.
