 * If foreign key handling is enabled, and applying a changeset leaves the database in a state containing foreign key violations, the conflict handler is invoked with this constant exactly once before the changeset is committed. If the conflict handler returns `SQLITE_CHANGESET_OMIT`, the changes, including those that caused the foreign key constraint violation, are committed. Or, if it returns `SQLITE_CHANGESET_ABORT`, the changeset is rolled back.
