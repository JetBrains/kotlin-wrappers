 * Activate inspector on host and port. Equivalent to`node --inspect=[[host:]port]`, but can be done programmatically after node has
 * started.
 *
 * If wait is `true`, will block until a client has connected to the inspect port
 * and flow control has been passed to the debugger client.
 *
 * See the `security warning` regarding the `host`parameter usage.
 * @param [port='what was specified on the CLI'] Port to listen on for inspector connections. Optional.
 * @param [host='what was specified on the CLI'] Host to listen on for inspector connections. Optional.
 * @param [wait=false] Block until a client has connected. Optional.
