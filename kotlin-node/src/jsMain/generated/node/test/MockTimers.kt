     * Enables timer mocking for the specified timers.
     *
     * **Note:** When you enable mocking for a specific timer, its associated

     *
     * Example usage:
     *
     * ```js
     * import { mock } from 'node:test';
     * mock.timers.enable(['setInterval']);
     * ```

     * implicitly mocks the `clearInterval` function. Only the `setInterval`and `clearInterval` functions from `node:timers`,`node:timers/promises`, and`globalThis` will be mocked.
     *
     * Alternatively, if you call `mock.timers.enable()` without any parameters:
     *
     * All timers (`'setInterval'`, `'clearInterval'`, `'setTimeout'`, and `'clearTimeout'`)
     * will be mocked. The `setInterval`, `clearInterval`, `setTimeout`, and `clearTimeout`functions from `node:timers`, `node:timers/promises`,
     * and `globalThis` will be mocked.
