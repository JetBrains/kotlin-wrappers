/**
 * Asserts that the function `fn` does not throw an error.
 *
 * Using `assert.doesNotThrow()` is actually not useful because there
 * is no benefit in catching an error and then rethrowing it. Instead, consider
 * adding a comment next to the specific code path that should not throw and keep
 * error messages as expressive as possible.
 *
 * When `assert.doesNotThrow()` is called, it will immediately call the `fn` function.
 *
 * If an error is thrown and it is the same type as that specified by the `error` parameter, then an `AssertionError` is thrown. If the error is of a
 * different type, or if the `error` parameter is undefined, the error is
 * propagated back to the caller.
 *
 * If specified, `error` can be a [`Class`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes),
 * [`RegExp`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions), or a validation
 * function. See {@link throws} for more details.
 *
 * The following, for instance, will throw the `TypeError` because there is no
 * matching error type in the assertion:
 *
 * ```js
 * import assert from 'node:assert/strict';
 *
 * assert.doesNotThrow(
 *   () => {
 *     throw new TypeError('Wrong value');
 *   },
 *   SyntaxError,
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * However, the following will result in an `AssertionError` with the message
 * 'Got unwanted exception...':
 *
 * ```js
 * import assert from 'node:assert/strict';
 *
 * assert.doesNotThrow(
 *   () => {
 *     throw new TypeError('Wrong value');
 *   },
 *   TypeError,
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * If an `AssertionError` is thrown and a value is provided for the `message` parameter, the value of `message` will be appended to the `AssertionError` message:
 *
 * ```js
 * import assert from 'node:assert/strict';
 *
 * assert.doesNotThrow(
 *   () => {
 *     throw new TypeError('Wrong value');
 *   },
 *   /Wrong value/,
 *   'Whoops',
 * );
 * // Throws: AssertionError: Got unwanted exception: Whoops
 * ```
