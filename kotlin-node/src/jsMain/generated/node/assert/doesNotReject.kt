/**
 * Awaits the `asyncFn` promise or, if `asyncFn` is a function, immediately
 * calls the function and awaits the returned promise to complete. It will then
 * check that the promise is not rejected.
 *
 * If `asyncFn` is a function and it throws an error synchronously,`assert.doesNotReject()` will return a rejected `Promise` with that error. If
 * the function does not return a promise, `assert.doesNotReject()` will return a
 * rejected `Promise` with an `ERR_INVALID_RETURN_VALUE` error. In both cases
 * the error handler is skipped.
 *
 * Using `assert.doesNotReject()` is actually not useful because there is little
 * benefit in catching a rejection and then rejecting it again. Instead, consider
 * adding a comment next to the specific code path that should not reject and keep
 * error messages as expressive as possible.
 *
 * If specified, `error` can be a [`Class`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes),
 * [`RegExp`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions), or a validation
 * function. See {@link throws} for more details.
 *
 * Besides the async nature to await the completion behaves identically to {@link doesNotThrow}.
