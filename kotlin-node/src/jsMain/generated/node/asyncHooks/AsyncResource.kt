/**
 * The class `AsyncResource` is designed to be extended by the embedder's async
 * resources. Using this, users can easily trigger the lifetime events of their
 * own resources.
 *
 * The `init` hook will trigger when an `AsyncResource` is instantiated.
 *
 * The following is an overview of the `AsyncResource` API.
 *
 * ```js
 * import { AsyncResource, executionAsyncId } from 'async_hooks';
 *
 * // AsyncResource() is meant to be extended. Instantiating a
 * // new AsyncResource() also triggers init. If triggerAsyncId is omitted then
 * // async_hook.executionAsyncId() is used.
 * const asyncResource = new AsyncResource(
 *   type, { triggerAsyncId: executionAsyncId(), requireManualDestroy: false }
 * );
 *
 * // Run a function in the execution context of the resource. This will
 * // * establish the context of the resource
 * // * trigger the AsyncHooks before callbacks
 * // * call the provided function `fn` with the supplied arguments
 * // * trigger the AsyncHooks after callbacks
 * // * restore the original execution context
 * asyncResource.runInAsyncScope(fn, thisArg, ...args);
 *
 * // Call AsyncHooks destroy callbacks.
 * asyncResource.emitDestroy();
 *
 * // Return the unique ID assigned to the AsyncResource instance.
 * asyncResource.asyncId();
 *
 * // Return the trigger ID for the AsyncResource instance.
 * asyncResource.triggerAsyncId();
 * ```
