/**
 * We strongly discourage the use of the `async_hooks` API.
 * Other APIs that can cover most of its use cases include:
 *
 * * `AsyncLocalStorage` tracks async context
 * * `process.getActiveResourcesInfo()` tracks active resources
 *
 * The `node:async_hooks` module provides an API to track asynchronous resources.
 * It can be accessed using:
 *
 * ```js
 * import async_hooks from 'node:async_hooks';
 * ```
 * @experimental
 * @see [source](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v20.2.0/lib/async_hooks.js)
