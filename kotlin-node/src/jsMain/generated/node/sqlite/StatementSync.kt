/**
 * This class represents a single [prepared statement](https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/stmt.html). This class cannot be
 * instantiated via its constructor. Instead, instances are created via the`database.prepare()` method. All APIs exposed by this class execute
 * synchronously.
 *
 * A prepared statement is an efficient binary representation of the SQL used to
 * create it. Prepared statements are parameterizable, and can be invoked multiple
 * times with different bound values. Parameters also offer protection against [SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) attacks. For these reasons, prepared statements are
 * preferred
 * over hand-crafted SQL strings when handling user input.
