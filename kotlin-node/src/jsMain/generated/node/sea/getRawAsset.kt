/**
 * This method can be used to retrieve the assets configured to be bundled into the
 * single-executable application at build time.
 * An error is thrown when no matching asset can be found.
 *
 * Unlike `sea.getRawAsset()` or `sea.getAssetAsBlob()`, this method does not
 * return a copy. Instead, it returns the raw asset bundled inside the executable.
 *
 * For now, users should avoid writing to the returned array buffer. If the
 * injected section is not marked as writable or not aligned properly,
 * writes to the returned array buffer is likely to result in a crash.
 * @since v20.12.0
