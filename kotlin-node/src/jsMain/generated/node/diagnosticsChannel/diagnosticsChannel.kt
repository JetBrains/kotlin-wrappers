/**
 * The `node:diagnostics_channel` module provides an API to create named channels
 * to report arbitrary message data for diagnostics purposes.
 *
 * It can be accessed using:
 *
 * ```js
 * import diagnostics_channel from 'node:diagnostics_channel';
 * ```
 *
 * It is intended that a module writer wanting to report diagnostics messages
 * will create one or many top-level channels to report messages through.
 * Channels may also be acquired at runtime but it is not encouraged
 * due to the additional overhead of doing so. Channels may be exported for
 * convenience, but as long as the name is known it can be acquired anywhere.
 *
 * If you intend for your module to produce diagnostics data for others to
 * consume it is recommended that you include documentation of what named
 * channels are used along with the shape of the message data. Channel names
 * should generally include the module name to avoid collisions with data from
 * other modules.
 * @since v15.1.0, v14.17.0
 * @see [source](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v20.13.1/lib/diagnostics_channel.js)
