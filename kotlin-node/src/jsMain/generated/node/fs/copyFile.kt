package node.fs


/**
 * Asynchronously copies `src` to `dest`. By default, `dest` is overwritten if it
 * already exists. No arguments other than a possible exception are given to the
 * callback function. Node.js makes no guarantees about the atomicity of the copy
 * operation. If an error occurs after the destination file has been opened for
 * writing, Node.js will attempt to remove the destination.
 *
 * `mode` is an optional integer that specifies the behavior
 * of the copy operation. It is possible to create a mask consisting of the bitwise
 * OR of two or more values (e.g.`fs.constants.COPYFILE_EXCL | fs.constants.COPYFILE_FICLONE`).
 *
 * * `fs.constants.COPYFILE_EXCL`: The copy operation will fail if `dest` already
 * exists.
 * * `fs.constants.COPYFILE_FICLONE`: The copy operation will attempt to create a
 * copy-on-write reflink. If the platform does not support copy-on-write, then a
 * fallback copy mechanism is used.
 * * `fs.constants.COPYFILE_FICLONE_FORCE`: The copy operation will attempt to
 * create a copy-on-write reflink. If the platform does not support
 * copy-on-write, then the operation will fail.
 *
 * ```js
 * import { copyFile, constants } from 'fs';
 *
 * function callback(err) {
 *   if (err) throw err;
 *   console.log('source.txt was copied to destination.txt');
 * }
 *
 * // destination.txt will be created or overwritten by default.
 * copyFile('source.txt', 'destination.txt', callback);
 *
 * // By using COPYFILE_EXCL, the operation will fail if destination.txt exists.
 * copyFile('source.txt', 'destination.txt', constants.COPYFILE_EXCL, callback);
 * ```
 * @since v8.5.0
 * @param src source filename to copy
 * @param dest destination filename of the copy operation
 * @param [mode=0] modifiers for copy operation.
