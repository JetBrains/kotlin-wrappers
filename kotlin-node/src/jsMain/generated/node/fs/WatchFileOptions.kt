/**
 * Watch for changes on `filename`. The callback `listener` will be called each
 * time the file is accessed.
 *
 * The `options` argument may be omitted. If provided, it should be an object. The`options` object may contain a boolean named `persistent` that indicates
 * whether the process should continue to run as long as files are being watched.
 * The `options` object may specify an `interval` property indicating how often the
 * target should be polled in milliseconds.
 *
 * The `listener` gets two arguments the current stat object and the previous
 * stat object:
 *
 * ```js
 * import { watchFile } from 'fs';
 *
 * watchFile('message.text', (curr, prev) => {
 *   console.log(`the current mtime is: ${curr.mtime}`);
 *   console.log(`the previous mtime was: ${prev.mtime}`);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * These stat objects are instances of `fs.Stat`. If the `bigint` option is `true`,
 * the numeric values in these objects are specified as `BigInt`s.
 *
 * To be notified when the file was modified, not just accessed, it is necessary
 * to compare `curr.mtimeMs` and `prev.mtimeMs`.
 *
 * When an `fs.watchFile` operation results in an `ENOENT` error, it
 * will invoke the listener once, with all the fields zeroed (or, for dates, the
 * Unix Epoch). If the file is created later on, the listener will be called
 * again, with the latest stat objects. This is a change in functionality since
 * v0.10.
 *
 * Using {@link watch} is more efficient than `fs.watchFile` and`fs.unwatchFile`. `fs.watch` should be used instead of `fs.watchFile` and`fs.unwatchFile` when possible.
 *
 * When a file being watched by `fs.watchFile()` disappears and reappears,
 * then the contents of `previous` in the second callback event (the file's
 * reappearance) will be the same as the contents of `previous` in the first
 * callback event (its disappearance).
 *
 * This happens when:
 *
 * * the file is deleted, followed by a restore
 * * the file is renamed and then renamed a second time back to its original name
 * @since v0.1.31
