package node.fs


/**
 * The `node:fs` module enables interacting with the file system in a
 * way modeled on standard POSIX functions.
 *
 * To use the promise-based APIs:
 *
 * ```js
 * import * as fs from 'node:fs/promises';
 * ```
 *
 * To use the callback and sync APIs:
 *
 * ```js
 * import * as fs from 'node:fs';
 * ```
 *
 * All file system operations have synchronous, callback, and promise-based
 * forms, and are accessible using both CommonJS syntax and ES6 Modules (ESM).
 * @see [source](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v20.2.0/lib/fs.js)
