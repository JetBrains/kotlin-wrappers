/**
 * Generates a snapshot of the current V8 heap and writes it to a JSON
 * file. This file is intended to be used with tools such as Chrome
 * DevTools. The JSON schema is undocumented and specific to the V8
 * engine, and may change from one version of V8 to the next.
 *
 * A heap snapshot is specific to a single V8 isolate. When using `worker threads`, a heap snapshot generated from the main thread will
 * not contain any information about the workers, and vice versa.
 *
 * Creating a heap snapshot requires memory about twice the size of the heap at
 * the time the snapshot is created. This results in the risk of OOM killers
 * terminating the process.
 *
 * Generating a snapshot is a synchronous operation which blocks the event loop
 * for a duration depending on the heap size.
 *
 * ```js
 * const { writeHeapSnapshot } = require('node:v8');
 * const {
 *   Worker,
 *   isMainThread,
 *   parentPort,
 * } = require('node:worker_threads');
 *
 * if (isMainThread) {
 *   const worker = new Worker(__filename);
 *
 *   worker.once('message', (filename) => {
 *     console.log(`worker heapdump: ${filename}`);
 *     // Now get a heapdump for the main thread.
 *     console.log(`main thread heapdump: ${writeHeapSnapshot()}`);
 *   });
 *
 *   // Tell the worker to create a heapdump.
 *   worker.postMessage('heapdump');
 * } else {
 *   parentPort.once('message', (message) => {
 *     if (message === 'heapdump') {
 *       // Generate a heapdump for the worker
 *       // and return the filename to the parent.
 *       parentPort.postMessage(writeHeapSnapshot());
 *     }
 *   });
 * }
 * ```
 * @since v11.13.0
 * @param filename The file path where the V8 heap snapshot is to be saved. If not specified, a file name with the pattern `'Heap-${yyyymmdd}-${hhmmss}-${pid}-${thread_id}.heapsnapshot'` will be
 * generated, where `{pid}` will be the PID of the Node.js process, `{thread_id}` will be `0` when `writeHeapSnapshot()` is called from the main Node.js thread or the id of a
 * worker thread.
 * @return The filename where the snapshot was saved.
