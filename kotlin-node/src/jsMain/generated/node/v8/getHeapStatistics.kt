/**
 * Returns an object with the following properties:
 *
 * `does_zap_garbage` is a 0/1 boolean, which signifies whether the `--zap_code_space` option is enabled or not. This makes V8 overwrite heap
 * garbage with a bit pattern. The RSS footprint (resident set size) gets bigger
 * because it continuously touches all heap pages and that makes them less likely
 * to get swapped out by the operating system.
 *
 * `number_of_native_contexts` The value of native\_context is the number of the
 * top-level contexts currently active. Increase of this number over time indicates
 * a memory leak.
 *
 * `number_of_detached_contexts` The value of detached\_context is the number
 * of contexts that were detached and not yet garbage collected. This number
 * being non-zero indicates a potential memory leak.
 *
 * `total_global_handles_size` The value of total\_global\_handles\_size is the
 * total memory size of V8 global handles.
 *
 * `used_global_handles_size` The value of used\_global\_handles\_size is the
 * used memory size of V8 global handles.
 *
 * `external_memory` The value of external\_memory is the memory size of array
 * buffers and external strings.
