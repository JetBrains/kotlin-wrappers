/**
 * The `v8.takeCoverage()` method allows the user to write the coverage started by `NODE_V8_COVERAGE` to disk on demand. This method can be invoked multiple
 * times during the lifetime of the process. Each time the execution counter will
 * be reset and a new coverage report will be written to the directory specified
 * by `NODE_V8_COVERAGE`.
 *
 * When the process is about to exit, one last coverage will still be written to
 * disk unless {@link stopCoverage} is invoked before the process exits.
 * @since v15.1.0, v14.18.0, v12.22.0
