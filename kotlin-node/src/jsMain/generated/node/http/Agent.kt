/**
 * An `Agent` is responsible for managing connection persistence
 * and reuse for HTTP clients. It maintains a queue of pending requests
 * for a given host and port, reusing a single socket connection for each
 * until the queue is empty, at which time the socket is either destroyed
 * or put into a pool where it is kept to be used again for requests to the
 * same host and port. Whether it is destroyed or pooled depends on the`keepAlive` `option`.
 *
 * Pooled connections have TCP Keep-Alive enabled for them, but servers may
 * still close idle connections, in which case they will be removed from the
 * pool and a new connection will be made when a new HTTP request is made for
 * that host and port. Servers may also refuse to allow multiple requests
 * over the same connection, in which case the connection will have to be
 * remade for every request and cannot be pooled. The `Agent` will still make
 * the requests to that server, but each one will occur over a new connection.
 *
 * When a connection is closed by the client or the server, it is removed
 * from the pool. Any unused sockets in the pool will be unrefed so as not
 * to keep the Node.js process running when there are no outstanding requests.
 * (see `socket.unref()`).
 *
 * It is good practice, to `destroy()` an `Agent` instance when it is no
 * longer in use, because unused sockets consume OS resources.
 *
 * Sockets are removed from an agent when the socket emits either
 * a `'close'` event or an `'agentRemove'` event. When intending to keep one
 * HTTP request open for a long time without keeping it in the agent, something
 * like the following may be done:
 *
 * ```js
 * http.get(options, (res) => {
 *   // Do stuff
 * }).on('socket', (socket) => {
 *   socket.emit('agentRemove');
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * An agent may also be used for an individual request. By providing`{agent: false}` as an option to the `http.get()` or `http.request()`functions, a one-time use `Agent` with default options
 * will be used
 * for the client connection.
 *
 * `agent:false`:
 *
 * ```js
 * http.get({
 *   hostname: 'localhost',
 *   port: 80,
 *   path: '/',
 *   agent: false  // Create a new agent just for this one request
 * }, (res) => {
 *   // Do stuff with response
 * });
 * ```
