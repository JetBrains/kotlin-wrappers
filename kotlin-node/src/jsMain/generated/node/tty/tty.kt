package node.tty

/**
 * The `node:tty` module provides the `tty.ReadStream` and `tty.WriteStream` classes. In most cases, it will not be necessary or possible to use this module
 * directly. However, it can be accessed using:
 *
 * ```js
 * const tty = require('node:tty');
 * ```
 *
 * When Node.js detects that it is being run with a text terminal ("TTY")
 * attached, `process.stdin` will, by default, be initialized as an instance of `tty.ReadStream` and both `process.stdout` and `process.stderr` will, by
 * default, be instances of `tty.WriteStream`. The preferred method of determining
 * whether Node.js is being run within a TTY context is to check that the value of
 * the `process.stdout.isTTY` property is `true`:
 *
 * ```console
 * $ node -p -e "Boolean(process.stdout.isTTY)"
 * true
 * $ node -p -e "Boolean(process.stdout.isTTY)" | cat
 * false
 * ```
 *
 * In most cases, there should be little to no reason for an application to
 * manually create instances of the `tty.ReadStream` and `tty.WriteStream` classes.
 * @see [source](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v20.13.1/lib/tty.js)
