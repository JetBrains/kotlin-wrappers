/**
 * Returns information about the currently effective user. On POSIX platforms,
 * this is typically a subset of the password file. The returned object includes
 * the `username`, `uid`, `gid`, `shell`, and `homedir`. On Windows, the `uid` and `gid` fields are `-1`, and `shell` is `null`.
 *
 * The value of `homedir` returned by `os.userInfo()` is provided by the operating
 * system. This differs from the result of `os.homedir()`, which queries
 * environment variables for the home directory before falling back to the
 * operating system response.
 *
 * Throws a [`SystemError`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v22.x/api/errors.html#class-systemerror) if a user has no `username` or `homedir`.
 * @since v6.0.0
