/**
 * Creates and returns a `Decipher` object that uses the given `algorithm`, `key` and initialization vector (`iv`).
 *
 * The `options` argument controls stream behavior and is optional except when a
 * cipher in CCM or OCB mode (e.g. `'aes-128-ccm'`) is used. In that case, the `authTagLength` option is required and specifies the length of the
 * authentication tag in bytes, see `CCM mode`. In GCM mode, the `authTagLength` option is not required but can be used to restrict accepted authentication tags
 * to those with the specified length.
 * For `chacha20-poly1305`, the `authTagLength` option defaults to 16 bytes.
 *
 * The `algorithm` is dependent on OpenSSL, examples are `'aes192'`, etc. On
 * recent OpenSSL releases, `openssl list -cipher-algorithms` will
 * display the available cipher algorithms.
 *
 * The `key` is the raw key used by the `algorithm` and `iv` is an [initialization vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector). Both arguments must be `'utf8'` encoded
 * strings,`Buffers`, `TypedArray`, or `DataView`s. The `key` may optionally be
 * a `KeyObject` of type `secret`. If the cipher does not need
 * an initialization vector, `iv` may be `null`.
 *
 * When passing strings for `key` or `iv`, please consider `caveats when using strings as inputs to cryptographic APIs`.
 *
 * Initialization vectors should be unpredictable and unique; ideally, they will be
 * cryptographically random. They do not have to be secret: IVs are typically just
 * added to ciphertext messages unencrypted. It may sound contradictory that
 * something has to be unpredictable and unique, but does not have to be secret;
 * remember that an attacker must not be able to predict ahead of time what a given
 * IV will be.
 * @since v0.1.94
 * @param options `stream.transform` options
