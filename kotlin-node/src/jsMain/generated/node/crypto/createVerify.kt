/**
 * Creates and returns a `Verify` object that uses the given algorithm.
 * Use {@link getHashes} to obtain an array of names of the available
 * signing algorithms. Optional `options` argument controls the `stream.Writable` behavior.
 *
 * In some cases, a `Verify` instance can be created using the name of a signature
 * algorithm, such as `'RSA-SHA256'`, instead of a digest algorithm. This will use
 * the corresponding digest algorithm. This does not work for all signature
 * algorithms, such as `'ecdsa-with-SHA256'`, so it is best to always use digest
 * algorithm names.
 * @since v0.1.92
 * @param options `stream.Writable` options
