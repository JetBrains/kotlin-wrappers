/**
 * The `Sign` class is a utility for generating signatures. It can be used in one
 * of two ways:
 *
 * * As a writable `stream`, where data to be signed is written and the `sign.sign()` method is used to generate and return the signature, or
 * * Using the `sign.update()` and `sign.sign()` methods to produce the
 * signature.
 *
 * The {@link createSign} method is used to create `Sign` instances. The
 * argument is the string name of the hash function to use. `Sign` objects are not
 * to be created directly using the `new` keyword.
 *
 * Example: Using `Sign` and `Verify` objects as streams:
 *
 * ```js
 * const {
 *   generateKeyPairSync,
 *   createSign,
 *   createVerify,
 * } = await import('node:crypto');
 *
 * const { privateKey, publicKey } = generateKeyPairSync('ec', {
 *   namedCurve: 'sect239k1',
 * });
 *
 * const sign = createSign('SHA256');
 * sign.write('some data to sign');
 * sign.end();
 * const signature = sign.sign(privateKey, 'hex');
 *
 * const verify = createVerify('SHA256');
 * verify.write('some data to sign');
 * verify.end();
 * console.log(verify.verify(publicKey, signature, 'hex'));
 * // Prints: true
 * ```
 *
 * Example: Using the `sign.update()` and `verify.update()` methods:
 *
 * ```js
 * const {
 *   generateKeyPairSync,
 *   createSign,
 *   createVerify,
 * } = await import('node:crypto');
 *
 * const { privateKey, publicKey } = generateKeyPairSync('rsa', {
 *   modulusLength: 2048,
 * });
 *
 * const sign = createSign('SHA256');
 * sign.update('some data to sign');
 * sign.end();
 * const signature = sign.sign(privateKey);
 *
 * const verify = createVerify('SHA256');
 * verify.update('some data to sign');
 * verify.end();
 * console.log(verify.verify(publicKey, signature));
 * // Prints: true
 * ```
