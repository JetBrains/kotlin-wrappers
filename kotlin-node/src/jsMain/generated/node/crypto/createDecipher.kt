/**
 * Creates and returns a `Decipher` object that uses the given `algorithm` and `password` (key).
 *
 * The `options` argument controls stream behavior and is optional except when a
 * cipher in CCM or OCB mode (e.g. `'aes-128-ccm'`) is used. In that case, the `authTagLength` option is required and specifies the length of the
 * authentication tag in bytes, see `CCM mode`.
 * For `chacha20-poly1305`, the `authTagLength` option defaults to 16 bytes.
 *
 * **This function is semantically insecure for all**
 * **supported ciphers and fatally flawed for ciphers in counter mode (such as CTR,**
 * **GCM, or CCM).**
 *
 * The implementation of `crypto.createDecipher()` derives keys using the OpenSSL
 * function [`EVP_BytesToKey`](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man3/EVP_BytesToKey.html) with the digest algorithm set to MD5, one
 * iteration, and no salt. The lack of salt allows dictionary attacks as the same
 * password always creates the same key. The low iteration count and
 * non-cryptographically secure hash algorithm allow passwords to be tested very
 * rapidly.
 *
 * In line with OpenSSL's recommendation to use a more modern algorithm instead of [`EVP_BytesToKey`](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man3/EVP_BytesToKey.html) it is recommended that
 * developers derive a key and IV on
 * their own using {@link scrypt} and to use {@link createDecipheriv} to create the `Decipher` object.
 * @since v0.1.94
 * @deprecated Since v10.0.0 - Use {@link createDecipheriv} instead.
 * @param options `stream.transform` options
