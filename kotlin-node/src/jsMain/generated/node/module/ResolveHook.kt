/**
 * The `resolve` hook chain is responsible for resolving file URL for a given module specifier and parent URL, and optionally its format (such as `'module'`) as a hint to the `load` hook.
 * If a format is specified, the load hook is ultimately responsible for providing the final `format` value (and it is free to ignore the hint provided by `resolve`);
 * if `resolve` provides a format, a custom `load` hook is required even if only to pass the value to the Node.js default `load` hook.
 *
 * @param specifier The specified URL path of the module to be resolved
 * @param context
 * @param nextResolve The subsequent `resolve` hook in the chain, or the Node.js default `resolve` hook after the last user-supplied resolve hook
