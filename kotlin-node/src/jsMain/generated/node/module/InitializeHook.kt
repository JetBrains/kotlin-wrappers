 * The `initialize` hook provides a way to define a custom function that runs in the hooks thread
 * when the hooks module is initialized. Initialization happens when the hooks module is registered via `register`.
 *
 * This hook can receive data from a `register` invocation, including ports and other transferrable objects.
 * The return value of `initialize` can be a `Promise`, in which case it will be awaited before the main application thread execution resumes.
